# Artificial Intelligence Subject 001 :brain:

-----------------

## Solve MNIST problem :1234:

This subject could be hard, so don't give up. Many resources are available about MNIST problems.

Obviously, even if you do not achieve a satisfactory result, detail your work, your research so that we can assess the rigor of your work.

### PyTorch

PyTorch is a famous python framework for deep learning. It's gaining interest in the deep learning community because of its syntactical similarities with python and operational similarities with numpy - which is the fundamental package for scientific and mathematical computing in Python.

### Neural Networks

Neural Network is, usually, a supervised method of learning. By supervised I mean, we know the target variable and its values for particular records and hence we can feed in this data to machine learning and deep learning algorithms and specify what it needs to learn. In contrast, the unsupervised learning methods require algorithms to just 'figure out' what are the relations between the records in the data that is fed into them.

Following 'layers' consists of a Neural Network

Input Layer
Hidden Layers
Output Layer
Every network has 1 input and 1 Output layer but can have any number of hidden layers, so in order to implement deep learning, we need at least 2 hidden layers in out network.

Details about a Neural Network, their different types and architecture is an active research topic and are already well defined and explained in numerous blogs and videos around the internet. Following are few links that I found relatively easy to understand:

- 3b1b's neural net video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&t=9s
- Medium neural net blog: https://towardsdatascience.com/first-neural-network-for-beginners-explained-with-code-4cfd37e06eaf
- Neural Network's Chart: https://towardsdatascience.com/the-mostly-complete-chart-of-neural-networks-explained-3fb6f2367464

P.S. I really enjoyed the DeepLizard.com's course on PyTorch. They have really started from the very basic and have ended on a fairly complex note and the learning was so intuitive, probably because they have covered every minute detail that goes on in PyTorch as well as Neural Networks and even Python. Just leaving their course's link here for anyone to get started with... something!

### MNIST Dataset

We are using the most famous Dataset for Computer Vision provided by the Turing Award holder and a very prominent personality in deep learning community: [Dr Yann LeCun.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_LeCun)

The dataset consists of 28x28 pixel, greyscale images. The rest of the details are given clearly in the description of this dataset.
